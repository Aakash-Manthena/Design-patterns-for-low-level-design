/**
 * This codebase demonstrates the implementation of the Strategy Design Pattern.
 * 
 * The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting 
 * an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates 
 * each one in a separate class, and makes them interchangeable. This promotes flexibility 
 * and reusability by allowing the behavior of a class to be changed without modifying its code.
 * 
 * In this codebase, the Strategy Design Pattern is leveraged by defining a common interface 
 * for a set of interchangeable strategies. Each strategy encapsulates a specific behavior or 
 * algorithm. The context class is designed to use these strategies dynamically, enabling 
 * runtime selection of the desired behavior. This approach decouples the algorithm's 
 * implementation from the context class, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle and promoting 
 * cleaner, more maintainable code.
